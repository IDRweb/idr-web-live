## New Biological Reactor

<!-- #### Summary -->

<strong>Optimization of the plant's biological treatment, increasing hydraulic capacity and treatment efficiency.</strong>

In 2018, a very significant improvement was implemented for the process, focusing basically on increasing the plant's treatment efficiency. This was achieved by modifying existing facilities and creating a new aerated biological reactor. This reactor has a capacity of 14,000 mÂ³ of water. Its function is to homogenize the incoming wastewater, regulate the flow and load uniformly throughout the seven days of the week and degrade the organic matter present in the water.

With the incorporation of this reactor, the other reactors in the treatment plant could be specialized: some were dedicated to nitrification (process by which bacteria transform ammonium to nitrates) and others to denitrification (process by which bacteria transform nitrates to atmospheric nitrogen). This has allowed for a more complete biological treatment, with a more efficient and well-segmented system between the different reactors.

Thanks to this new system, the treatment plant manages to treat water more efficiently, obtaining an optimal final result.
