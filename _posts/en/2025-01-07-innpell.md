<!-- #### Explanation -->

The INNPELL project, led by A3 Leather Innovation Center with the collaboration of IDR, LCB and other sector companies, is an innovative strategy designed to transform and improve global integration in the leather sector. This strategy focuses on optimizing leather transformation processes, significantly reducing process time and achieving more efficient and sustainable production. In addition, it contributes to a considerable reduction in the wastewater load that needs to be treated, which has a direct impact on the sector's environmental sustainability.

The project facilitates the elimination of substances such as chlorides, sulfides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), while achieving a 30% reduction in other products used during the leather tanning process. The application of this system on an industrial scale would significantly improve the wastewater treatment process, as it eliminates the use of sulfides and reduces the presence of chlorides by 90%, thus contributing to more responsible and efficient management of water resources and a reduction in the sector's environmental impact.
