<!-- #### Summary -->

<strong>Optimization of sludge treatment, optimizing dehydration, reducing bad odors and preventing leaching in its subsequent management.</strong>

<!-- #### Explanation -->

In 2023, an important improvement was implemented in the sludge treatment of the treatment plant through the addition of lime.

This action was preceded by an exhaustive study on the efficiency and viability of this new treatment, carried out through an industrial pilot at the same treatment plant facilities. The results obtained from the previous study were very positive and confirmed that the addition of lime is an effective, economically viable and environmentally responsible solution for improving sludge management.

The addition of lime to the sludge, through a lime slurry, helps stabilize it, with various environmental benefits. The lime reduces the acidity of the sludge and creates an alkaline environment that neutralizes volatile compounds and very significantly reduces bad odors. In addition, it improves the dehydration of centrifuged sludge, obtaining drier sludge and preventing metal leaching in subsequent composting.

The objective of the improvement has been to stabilize the sludge, reduce possible environmental impacts and improve its subsequent management, particularly with regard to its subsequent biostabilization.
