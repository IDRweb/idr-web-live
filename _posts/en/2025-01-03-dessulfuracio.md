<!-- #### Summary -->

<strong>Optimization of the desulfurization process, accelerating the reaction and reducing foams.</strong>

In 2018, a significant improvement was implemented in the desulfurization process of the treatment plant to optimize its efficiency. This improvement consisted of replacing the conventional system with atmospheric air with the addition of liquid oxygen to the desulfurization ponds.

This improvement began with an industrial test in which a liquid oxygen addition system was installed in one of the two desulfurization ponds of the treatment plant, to be able to compare the results. The results demonstrated that the addition of liquid oxygen significantly accelerated the desulfurization reaction, much more than the conventional system. In addition, foam formation during the reaction was significantly reduced, which facilitated process control and improved system safety and stability.

Finally, it was decided to definitively replace the two ponds with a liquid oxygen desulfurization system, thus achieving a reduction in the time necessary to eliminate sulfides from the water, avoid foam formation and optimize the entire desulfurization process.
