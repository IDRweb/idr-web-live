<!-- #### Explanation -->

The ReBioenergia project, led by Leather Cluster Barcelona and IDR, promotes a new way of managing treatment plant sludge and other terminal waste from the leather industry, with an approach focused on sustainability and innovation. The goal is to achieve zero waste and reduce dependence on landfills through efficient and responsible solutions.

The project bets on sector decarbonization, incorporating composting practices and advanced thermal treatment technologies to convert this waste into renewable energy sources and valorizable materials. This initiative not only contributes to environmental protection, but also aligns with European environmental regulations and the sustainability standards of major international leather fashion brands.

With ReBioenergia, the sector takes a step forward towards a circular and planet-respectful model.
